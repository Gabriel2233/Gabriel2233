# Hi there, I'm Gabriel  :rocket:

## About Me :eyes:

Development has always been my passion, and I'm always looking forward to learn new things and discover new tools. My main objective is build things that bring value to the world, using the best technologies and strategies to help people and companies achieve their objectives.

> When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.

If you want to talk, it'll be a pleasure :smiley:
